- 👋 Hi, I’m @legitpunk
- 👀 I’m interested in web2 development, architecture, animations, sever software, database architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning php, and shall eventually learn C# and C++, ASP.NET and other MS development software.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a platform that makes "media content sites" with installable and configurable features such as social networking, auctions, webcart sites, 
project collab, forums, news sites and more. I have been developing the platform for a few years, have made most of the code, and could do with a developer or two who might 
be interested in investing some time towards a future company (within a year).

Thus far the platform is being made with PHP 7.4 tho should work on PHP 8, and later will be developed with C#, C++.

I have made most of the platform in parts. It just needs a developer or two to add some of the basic functionalities (most of which would be copy and paste from code 
I've written). 

I'm looking for PHP developers who have created their own large projects, or developers who 
are familiar with securing apps and projects in general, and are aware of PHP's insecurities, and also looking for developers who know how to tweak software to make better 
server response times. 

You can read more about the platform at http://www.legitpunk.com/platform_project (viewable after 21/10/2021) 

A few notes on the platform:

Marketing and revenue generation:

When the platform is made, the company shall then use it to create a bunch of new sites like tik tok and youtube, to make sites with which to generate revenue. 
These sites have marketing plans behind them to ensure that they spread quickly and effectively among social networks.
For use of the platform, which will be made available to anyone at no cost, they have to allow the "public posts and public content" on their database to be shared with the
main databases that our company's media content sites will be using. Some of these sites we expect to be large social networking sites due to the marketing campaigns 
we have for them. 
It's been designed with a Resource-Orientated Architecture design pattern (or rather a GUI orientated design pattern), for User Experience reasons, which were 
derived from thorough market research.
GUI design has placed consitency and inutitive design at the foremost goals.

Technical:

I've made the youtube, facebook, instagram, forums and news sites parts of it. Code just needs to be slapped together. 
It selects blocks of html code to render based on the user's viewport size, and auto-sizes the html elements with inline css that's calculated in php.
Eventually (when developing in C# C++) it'll have a browser that allows users to post content directly to or from the net.
It uses libsodium 512 hashing with a "type" of security system similar to blockchain technology.
It uses a new type of coding style that loads extremely less code at run time, making the code efficient for server use (intial test was 98% more efficient that 
PHP coded in OOP).
It's heavily modulised, uses no frameworks (all internal frameworks have been natively coded).
It has themeing options. 
It also lets users customise almost every aspect. If it displays, it can be customised and saved in user settings, and applied lyve with animations. 
It creates a seperate database for every user, every domain-based site, every group, and more. 

There's also research options available to discuss creating a new type of database engine. I've had some success in creating multidimensional database queries and records.
