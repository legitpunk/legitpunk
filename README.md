- 👋 Hi, I’m @legitpunk
- 👀 I’m interested in web2 development, architecture, animations, sever software, database architecture.
- 🌱 I’m advanced in php, html5, css3, javascript and jgquery and MySQL 5, mariaDB, opencart, worpdress and some plugins, blob files, database management, database design, and various other skills available for view on seek.co.nz.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a platform that makes "media content sites" with installable and configurable features such as social networking, auctions, webcart sites, 
project collab, forums, news sites and more. I have been developing the platform for a few years, have made most of the code, and could do with a developer or two who might 
be interested in investing some time towards a future company (within a year).

the platform project updates are at: 
Media Post Site (MPS)
on discord. 

a lot of the code that's featured on this account my seem obscure though most of the functions and code is ported from my platform or tools that were made to help create parts of the platform just as the hash generator or directory viewer. 

Thank you for viewing my github and please to meet you :)
